This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Jumpsuit Demo ([View it here](https://hugochinchilla.github.io/jumpsuit-slides/))

This is a demo project prepared for the [MallorcaJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/MallorcaJS/)

Instead of preparing a few slides to explain [Jumpsuit](https://jumpsuit.js.org/), I opted to use Jumpsuit to create some slides :-P
